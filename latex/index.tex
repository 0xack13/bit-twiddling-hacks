The Bit\+Operations project contains several bit operations and manipulations, also known as \textquotesingle{}bit hacks\textquotesingle{}. These functions and function macros can be used in code to easily perform operations on variables. A complete list of these functons and function macros can be found on the \href{BitOperations_8h.html}{\tt Bit\+Operations.\+h} documentation page.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Some of the functions used in this project are based on \href{https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html}{\tt Sean Eron Anderson\textquotesingle{}s Bit Twiddling Hacks.} See \href{https://github.com/gibsjose/BitHacks/blob/master/BitHacks.md}{\tt Joe Gibson\textquotesingle{}s Markdown version} for more information about the oparations and, for example, the amount of instructions needed for those functions. A full list of those functions can be found in the \href{BitOperations_8h.html#details}{\tt Detailed description of Bit\+Operations.\+h}.

\hypertarget{index_usage}{}\section{Usage}\label{index_usage}
In order to use this code the only thing that you need to do is copy {\ttfamily \hyperlink{BitOperations_8h}{Bit\+Operations.\+h}} and {\ttfamily \hyperlink{BitOperations_8c}{Bit\+Operations.\+c}} to your project and include {\ttfamily \hyperlink{BitOperations_8h}{Bit\+Operations.\+h}} in the files where you intend to use the Bit\+Operations. These two files can be found in every \href{https://github.com/vidavidorra/BitOperations/releases}{\tt release} in the {\ttfamily source} and {\ttfamily source/src} folders respectively.\hypertarget{index_unit_test}{}\section{Unit test}\label{index_unit_test}
The purpose of this unit test is not to verify that the arithmetic is correct, because Sean Eron Anderson already tested that thoroughly. This unit test verifies that the implementation is correct. Please refer to the \href{https://github.com/vidavidorra/BitOperations}{\tt Git\+Hub repo} for results on the coverage and unit tests.\hypertarget{index_licensing}{}\section{Licensing}\label{index_licensing}
